    I would consider the following points while optimizing the angular 2 app:
            Consider AOT compilation.
            Application is bundled, uglified, and tree shaking should be done.
            Application doesnâ€™t have un-necessary import statements.
            Any 3rd party library, which is not used, is removed from the application.
            Have all dependencies and dev-dependencies are clearly separated.
            Consider lazy loading instead of fully bundled app if the app size is more.
