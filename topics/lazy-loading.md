Lazy loading is a technique in Angular that allows you to load JavaScript components asynchronously when a specific route is activated. 

With lazy loading our application does not need to load everything at once, it only needs to load what the user expects to see when the app first loads. Modules that are lazily loaded will only be loaded when the user navigates to their routes.
